# Data structure

The figures presented are dependency diagrams, meaning that an arrow stemming from a node points to a node that the stem depends on (i.e. “A depends on B” is equivalent to “A —> B”).

Colors indicate data kinds. To load tables with different data kinds, you currently need more than one get_df (or get_array) commands.
