# Test on each PR.
# We run three types of tests:
#  - Pytest -> these are the "normal" tests and should be run for all
#    python versions
#  - Coveralls -> this is to see if we are covering all our lines of
#    code with our tests. The results get uploaded to
#    coveralls.io/github/WashU-Astroparticle-Lab/straxion
