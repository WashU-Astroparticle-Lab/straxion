# Cursor Rules for Straxion Project

## CRITICAL: Conda Environment Requirement
**MANDATORY**: ALL Python commands, test runs, and scripts MUST be
executed with the `straxion` conda environment activated.

## Command Format Rules
- **REQUIRED**: Every Python command, pytest command, or script execution
  MUST be prefixed with `conda activate straxion &&`
- **DO NOT** run commands like `python -m pytest` directly
- **ALWAYS** run commands like: `conda activate straxion && python -m
  pytest ...`
- This applies to ALL terminal commands that use Python or project
  dependencies

## Examples
✅ CORRECT: `conda activate straxion && python -m pytest tests/test_match.py`
✅ CORRECT: `conda activate straxion && python scripts/online_monitor.py`
❌ WRONG: `python -m pytest tests/test_match.py` (missing conda activate)
❌ WRONG: `cd /path && python -m pytest ...` (missing conda activate)

## Why This Matters
The project dependencies are installed in the `straxion` conda environment.
Running commands without activating this environment will result in
ModuleNotFoundError or other dependency issues.
